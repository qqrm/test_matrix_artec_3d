# test_matrix_artec_3d

This project is a test task for Arte—Å 3D and provides a header-only library with a template matrix class and some matrix operations. It also includes simple tests to verify the functionality of the matrix class.

## Operations

The matrix class supports the following operations:

- Matrix Addition (summ)
- Matrix Multiplication (mul)
- Matrix Concatenation (concat)
- Matrix Resizing (resize)

## Running Tests

To run the tests, follow these steps:

1. Build the project.
2. Execute the `matrix_test` binary located in the `build` directory.

Example:

```bash
cd build
./matrix_test
```

## Building the Project

To build the project, you can use the provided build system or a CMake-based build system. Here's a basic example using CMake:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
